Backwards Incompatible Changes
==============================

Setting image mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you attempt to set the mode of an image directly, e.g.
``im.mode = "RGBA"``, you will now receive an ``AttributeError``. This is
not about removing existing functionality, but instead about raising an
explicit error to prevent later consequences. The ``convert`` method is the
correct way to change an image's mode.

ImageOps.cover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns a resized version of the image, so that the requested size is covered,
while maintaining the original aspect ratio.

See :ref:`relative-resize` for a comparison between this and similar ImageOps
methods.
